{"title":"HoFs","message":"High Order Functions are functions that either list other functions as paramters, and or return Functions as values. Typically, the abstract away the complexity of some process, and hide this complexity behind a simple verb - the name of the Function. By listing other Functions as parameters, the design of a Higher Order Function facilitates flexibility because we don't have to commit at design-time to a certain action the High Order Function will execute.\n\nA higher-order function is a function that does one of the following: \n\n* Takes another function as an argument.\n* Returns another function as its result.\n\nFor example: \n\nfunction fun() {\n    console.log(\"Hello, World!\");\n}\nfunction fun2(action) {\n    action();\n    action();\n}\n\nfun2(fun);\n\n* fun2 is a higher order function because it takes another function (action) as an argument. \n\n* It calls the action function twice.","id":"ef846ebe-20bf-40e2-ad66-d0719bdfbd77","date":"2025-03-31T18:26:44.585Z","updated":"2025-04-12T00:17:27.636Z"}
